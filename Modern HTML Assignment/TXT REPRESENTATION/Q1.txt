Q1.List out the features of HTML5?

Ans. HTML5, the fifth revision of the Hypertext Markup Language, introduced a variety of new features and enhancements over its predecessor, HTML4. Some of the key features of HTML5 include:
Semantics: HTML5 introduces new semantic elements like <article>, <section>, <header>, <nav>, <footer>, etc., which provide a better structure to web documents and improve accessibility.
Multimedia Support: Native support for audio and video elements (<audio> and <video>), eliminating the need for third-party plugins like Flash. This allows for easier embedding and playback of multimedia content.
Canvas: The <canvas> element provides a drawing surface that allows dynamic rendering of graphics, charts, and other visualizations through JavaScript.
Offline Web Applications: HTML5 introduces the Application Cache (AppCache) feature, enabling web applications to work offline by caching resources like HTML files, stylesheets, and images.
Geolocation: HTML5 provides a Geolocation API that allows websites to request the user's geographical location. This can be used for location-based services and other applications.
Web Storage: The introduction of the localStorage and sessionStorage APIs allows web applications to store data locally on the user's device, providing a more efficient and persistent alternative to cookies.
WebSockets: HTML5 includes the WebSocket API, which enables bidirectional communication between the browser and the server over a single, long-lived connection. This is useful for real-time applications.
Responsive Design: HTML5 includes features that support responsive web design, such as the <meta> tag for viewport control and media queries in CSS for adapting styles based on the device's characteristics.
New Form Input Types: HTML5 introduces new input types like <input type="date">, <input type="email">, <input type="url">, etc., providing more options for form validation and improving the user experience.
Drag-and-Drop Support: HTML5 includes native support for drag-and-drop functionality, making it easier for users to interact with elements on a web page.
Microdata: HTML5 introduces the ability to embed custom data attributes using microdata, allowing for more structured and machine-readable content.
Accessibility Improvements: HTML5 includes features that enhance accessibility, such as the ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes, which help make web content more usable for people with disabilities.
These features collectively contribute to making HTML5 a more versatile and powerful markup language for modern web development. Keep in mind that browser support for these features may vary, so it's essential to consider cross-browser compatibility when developing web applications.
