Q2. What are HTML Entities? List out 5 commonly used HTML entities?
Ans HTML entities are special codes used to represent characters that have a specific meaning in HTML or characters that cannot be easily typed on a keyboard. They are often used to display reserved characters, such as <, >, &, and special characters like accented letters or symbols. Here are five commonly used HTML entities:

1. `&lt;` - Represents the less-than symbol (<).
2. `&gt;` - Represents the greater-than symbol (>).
3. `&amp;` - Represents the ampersand (&).
4. `&quot;` - Represents the double quotation mark (").
5. `&apos;` or `&lsquo;` - Represents the apostrophe or single quotation mark (').

These entities are crucial for ensuring that reserved characters are properly displayed in HTML documents and for handling characters that might otherwise be interpreted as HTML markup.
